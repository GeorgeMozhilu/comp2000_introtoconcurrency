Two Friend objects are created: alphonse and gaston.

Two threads are started, each calling the bow method on one Friend object, passing the other Friend as an argument.

When the program runs, it will likely deadlock. Here's what happens:

Thread 1 calls alphonse.bow(gaston). It acquires the lock on alphonse.

Thread 2 calls gaston.bow(alphonse). It acquires the lock on gaston.

Thread 1 tries to call gaston.bowBack(alphonse), but it can't because Thread 2 holds the lock on gaston.

Thread 2 tries to call alphonse.bowBack(gaston), but it can't because Thread 1 holds the lock on alphonse.

### At the point where the program locks up:

Thread 1 owns the lock on alphonse and is waiting for the lock on gaston.
Thread 2 owns the lock on gaston and is waiting for the lock on alphonse.
This is a classic deadlock situation.

To unlock the program without touching the synchronized keywords, we can use a technique called "lock ordering" or "lock hierarchy". Here's how we can modify the code:

```java
public class Deadlock {
    static class Friend {
        private final String name;
        private final int id;
        public Friend(String name, int id) {
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id;
        }
        public String getName() {
            return this.name;
        }
        public void bow(Friend bower) {
            Friend first = this.id < bower.id ? this : bower;
            Friend second = this.id < bower.id ? bower : this;
            
            synchronized(first) {
                synchronized(second) {
                    System.out.format("%s: %s has bowed to me!%n", 
                        this.name, bower.getName());
                    bower.bowBack(this);
                }
            }
        }
        public void bowBack(Friend bower) {
            System.out.format("%s: %s has bowed back to me!%n",
                this.name, bower.getName());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Friend alphonse = new Friend("Alphonse", 1);
        final Friend gaston = new Friend("Gaston", 2);
        new Thread(() -> alphonse.bow(gaston)).start();
        new Thread(() -> gaston.bow(alphonse)).start();
    }
}
```

### Key changes:

Added an id field to the Friend class.
Modified the bow method to always acquire locks in a consistent order (lower id first).
Removed synchronized from method signatures and used synchronized blocks instead.
Removed synchronized from bowBack as it's now protected by the outer synchronized blocks.
This solution ensures that both threads will always try to acquire the locks in the same order, preventing deadlock. If Thread 1 and Thread 2 both try to bow at the same time, they will both try to acquire the lock on the Friend with the lower id first. Whichever thread gets this lock first will then be able to acquire the second lock and complete its bow, while the other thread will wait for both locks to be released before proceeding.

This approach solves the deadlock problem without removing synchronization, ensuring that the program remains thread-safe while avoiding the possibility of deadlock.
